# NLP_DisasterTweet_Proj
Google Colab project created to learn about Natural Language Processing/Sentiment Analysis. 

This project was developed as my capstone project in my Machine Learning II class, where we were tasked to build and train 
neural network models. The dataset chosen was from a kaggle competition designed for beginners in NLP. This dataset contains
disaster and non disaster tweets, using binary classification. The framework Scikit-Learn, and libraries such as NumPy, TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, and Matplotlib were used.
RNN models such as LSTM, GRU, BidirectionGRU, BidirectionLSTM were used, along with a pretrained embedding model from TF Hub.
After using various models and parameters, I was able to reach a training classification accuracy of 80.93%.
